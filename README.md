LLM and RAG practice repo: publication knowledge base

Chat-like front-end interface based on [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) using a Large Language Model (LLM) in the back-end (locally with [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)) for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) of my publications (papers and patents).

TODO:
- Create knowledge base using [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) framework
