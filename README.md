LLM and RAG practice repo: publication knowledge base

Chat-like front-end interface based on [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) using a Large Language Model (LLM) in the back-end (locally with [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)) for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) of my publications (papers and patents).

Please reach out if you are interested in obtaining the PDFs of my publications to fully test the program as-is. It expects the PDFs to be located in folder `/pubs`.

TODO:
- Create knowledge base using [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) framework
